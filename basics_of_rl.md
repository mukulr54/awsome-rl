Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on **learning from actions and feedback**. It is different from supervised learning, where the model is given labeled data and learns to predict the correct output. In reinforcement learning, the model is not given any explicit guidance, but instead learns by **trial and error** what actions lead to the best outcomes in a given situation.

A reinforcement learning model consists of an **agent** that interacts with an **environment** and learns to achieve a **goal**. The agent chooses an action based on its current state, and the environment responds with a new state and a **reward**. The reward is a numerical signal that indicates how well the agent is doing. The agent's objective is to **maximize the cumulative reward** over time.

Reinforcement learning can be modeled as a **Markov decision process (MDP)**, which is a mathematical framework that captures the dynamics of the environment and the agent's decision making. An MDP consists of a set of states, a set of actions, a transition function that defines the probability of moving from one state to another given an action, and a reward function that defines the reward for each state-action pair.

Reinforcement learning algorithms can be classified into two main types: **value-based** and **policy-based**. Value-based algorithms learn to estimate the value or expected return of each state or state-action pair, and choose the action that maximizes the value. Policy-based algorithms learn to directly optimize the policy or probability distribution over actions for each state, without relying on value estimates.

Some examples of reinforcement learning applications are:

- Game playing: Reinforcement learning can be used to train agents to play complex games such as chess, Go, or Atari games. For example, AlphaGo is a famous reinforcement learning system that defeated the world champion of Go in 2016.
- Robotics: Reinforcement learning can be used to teach robots to perform various tasks such as walking, grasping, or manipulating objects. For example, OpenAI's Dactyl is a reinforcement learning system that learned to manipulate a Rubik's cube using a robotic hand.
- Self-driving cars: Reinforcement learning can be used to train autonomous vehicles to navigate complex and dynamic environments such as roads, traffic, and pedestrians. For example, Waymo is a company that uses reinforcement learning to improve its self-driving technology.
